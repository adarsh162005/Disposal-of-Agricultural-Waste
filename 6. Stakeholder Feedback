        <th>Your Learnings for Further Improvement of Your Prototype</th>
        <td style="text-align: justify;">
    <p>The prototype's successful incorporation of the soil moisture sensor and water pump functionality provides a solid foundation, but there are several areas for further improvement. Ensuring the sensor's accuracy and reliability through calibration routines will be crucial, while enhancing the display to clearly communicate moisture levels and other data points can improve user understanding and interaction. Optimizing the water pump control algorithms, and considering energy-efficient alternatives, are also recommended.</p>
