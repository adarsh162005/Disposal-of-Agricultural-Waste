    <li>
        <strong>Scalability and Adaptability:</strong>
        <p>Our solution can be scaled up for a larger population by collaborating with street food vendors and gathering as much kitchen waste as possible, producing compost on a larger scale.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Long Term Viability:</strong>
        <p>Our solution can continue without external funding as it is completely made up of natural waste, mainly kitchen waste, so our solution can continue without external funding.</p>
