<!-- Point of View Statement -->
<h3>3.2 POINT OF VIEW STATEMENT</h3>
<p>
    Farmers of Yellur, Belagavi need proper guidance to dispose of agricultural waste. However, due to a lack of knowledge, poor financial conditions, unavailability of land, and inadequate government support, they struggle to grow as successful farmers despite their interest in disposing of and reusing agricultural waste.
